#INTROSPECTION



#WHY MUST WE CHOOSE YOU?

Well, I am interested in learning new things and just the thought of acquiring unimaginable knowledge and skills from the prestigious club fascinates me. I am very friendly and an open-minded person, so cant wait to meet all the various interesting personalities of the club. Mainly, I want to get out of my comfort zone and work hard as to better myself as each day passes. Also, this will surely play a mjaor role in polishing my career.     



#WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?

With the guidance and advice from mentors, I will look up to what is best for me and how I can contribute immensely to the club. Its just the beginning,but with the resources I am provided with, I will try my best to make sure I can be trusted with any tasks provided. Also i would like to attend different competitions and expand the club's name.



#HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?

Just like the mentors helped me know about the idea of the club,I will help my fellow members and juniors or anyone who needs help. I would like to complete specific tasks for the clubs development.



#DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK FOR THE SELECTION PROCESS?

The tasks were fun but challenging,but with the help of mentors I learned a lot. I wished if there were more guidance on few challenging tasks but again, google is our best source.
